```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hft-mastery
cd hft-mastery

# Recommended learning path
1. Start with MODULE 1 (Market Fundamentals)
2. Build up through Modules 2-4 (Math & Microstructure)
3. Jump to MODULE 7 (ML for Trading) if you already know finance
4. Use MODULE 11-12 for building actual systems
```



## 💡 Learning Recommendations

### For AI/ML Engineers (Like You!)
```
Path: ML Engineer → ML Quant Developer → ML Researcher

Priority Order:
1. MODULE 1 (understand markets)
2. MODULE 2 (refresh statistics)
3. MODULE 5 (feature engineering - your specialty)
4. MODULE 7 (ML for trading)
5. MODULE 8 (advanced architectures)
6. MODULE 9 (risk management)
12. MODULE 12 (backtesting your models)
```

### For Full-Stack HFT Developers
```
Path: Complete all modules in order
Emphasis: Modules 10-11 (systems and C++)
Timeline: 18-24 months to mastery
```

### For Quant Researchers
```
Path: Modules 2-4, 6-8, 13
Skip: 10-11 (systems knowledge not needed)
Focus: Novel strategy research
```

### For HFT Startup Founders
```
Path: ALL modules essential
Need: Broad knowledge + team building
Timeline: 2 years solo learning, then build team
```
